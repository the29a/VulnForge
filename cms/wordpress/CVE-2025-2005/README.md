# CVE-2025-2005
The Front End Users plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads due to missing file type validation in the file uploads field of the registration form in all versions up to, and including, 3.2.32. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to upload arbitrary files on the affected site's server which may make remote code execution possible.

## Notes
Fails to validate vulnerability. Files are not uploaded without a field with the `File` type. If the field is added, the file is uploaded without validation.

## Metrics
CVSSv2: N\A   
CVSSv3: 9.8 CRITICAL   

## Vulnerability Environment
Build and run:
```bash
docker compose build
docker compose up -d
```
Stop Environment and remove network:
```bash
docker compose down
```
## Detection and exploitation example
1. Run Environment
2. Login to Wordpress (vulnforge / vulnforge123)
3. In general setting set URL to your IP address
4. Add new field in Front End Only Users Settings, type: File (see Notes)
5. Create new page
6. Place "[register]" on the page where you want your registration form to display
7. Run PoC:

```shell
python3 poc.py --url 'http://<your_ip>:8080/' --newuser vulnuser1 --newpassword vulnpassword
```
After the request, the file will be saved in `wp-content/uploads/2025/04/ewd-feup-user-upload/[RANDOMIZED_FILENAME].php`

The filename will not match the uploaded name (e.g., shell.php) but can be discovered manually or guessed with a scanner.
